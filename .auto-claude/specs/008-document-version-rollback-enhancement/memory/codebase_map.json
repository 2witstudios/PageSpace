      "description": "Diff library verified for document version comparison. Recommendation: Use `diff` package (jsdiff) v7.x. Already a transitive dependency (v4.0.2 via jest-diff) confirming project compatibility. Features: diffChars(), diffWords(), diffLines(), diffSentences(), createPatch(), applyPatch(). Zero dependencies, pure JavaScript, fully React 19 compatible. Built-in TypeScript types since v5.x. ~40KB minified, ~12KB gzipped. BSD-3-Clause license. Alternative considered: diff-match-patch (Google's library) - more complex API, requires @types/diff-match-patch, better for edit distance algorithms but overkill for document comparison.",
