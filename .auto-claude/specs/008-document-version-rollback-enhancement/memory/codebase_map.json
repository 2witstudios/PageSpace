      "description": "Diff library verified for document version comparison. Recommendation: Use `diff` package (jsdiff) v7.x. Already a transitive dependency (v4.0.2 via jest-diff) confirming project compatibility. Features: diffChars(), diffWords(), diffLines(), diffSentences(), createPatch(), applyPatch(). Zero dependencies, pure JavaScript, fully React 19 compatible. Built-in TypeScript types since v5.x. ~40KB minified, ~12KB gzipped. BSD-3-Clause license. Alternative considered: diff-match-patch (Google's library) - more complex API, requires @types/diff-match-patch, better for edit distance algorithms but overkill for document comparison.",

      "description": "React diff viewer component verified: react-diff-viewer-continued@4.0.6 is the RECOMMENDED choice. Key findings: (1) Explicitly supports React 19 in peerDependencies (^19.0.0), (2) Small bundle: 27.7KB minified, 9.3KB gzipped, (3) Uses same `diff` package we're using for backend, (4) Built-in TypeScript types, ESM + CJS support, (5) MIT license, (6) Updated May 2025, active maintenance, (7) Uses @emotion/css for styling (compatible with Tailwind). Alternative considered: react-diff-view@3.3.2 - larger bundle (73.5KB/23.6KB gzipped), designed for git unified diff format which adds complexity, uses lodash (heavier), permissive React version but not explicit React 19 support. DECISION: Use react-diff-viewer-continued@4.0.6 for the version comparison UI due to explicit React 19 support, smaller bundle, and simpler API for document content diffing.",
