  "task_description": "# Document Version Rollback Enhancement\n\nImprove the document version history and rollback system to handle edge cases, provide better visual diffs, and support selective rollback of specific changes.\n\n## Rationale\nVersion history is essential for collaborative editing. The current rollback feature has documented limitations that need attention. Robust version control builds user trust that they can experiment without fear of data loss.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a content creator, I want to see exactly what changed between versions so that I can understand the edit history\n- As a team lead, I want to rollback specific changes so that I can undo mistakes without losing other work\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Users can view visual diff between any two versions\n- [ ] Rollback handles all content types including embedded files\n- [ ] Partial rollback allows reverting specific sections\n- [ ] Version history is maintained for at least 30 days on all plans\n- [ ] Large document versions are handled efficiently (compression/storage optimization)\n",
