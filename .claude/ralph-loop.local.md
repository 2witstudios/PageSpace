TASK: Converge the current open Pull Request to merge-ready by addressing every review comment, replying to each thread, ensuring all CI checks pass, and completing the existing implementation plan.\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- PR has ZERO unresolved review threads/conversations.\n- Every reviewer comment has been explicitly acknowledged with a reply explaining what changed (or why no change is needed).\n- All required CI checks are green (no failing or pending required checks).\n- The original plan (the one this PR is based on) is fully completed: all planned tasks are implemented, and any plan checklist/tracker is updated to show completion.\n- Repo validations pass locally where applicable (tests/build/lint/typecheck for this repo), or CI equivalents are confirmed green.\n- PR description is up to date (summarize what changed + how to validate), and no TODO/FIXME markers remain related to review feedback.\n\nPROCESS (repeat until success):\n1) Discover the PR context: identify the PR number/link, read the PR description, commits, files changed, and the plan/tracker the PR references.\n2) Collect all feedback: list every review comment + thread, label each as (a) code change required, (b) question/clarification, (c) optional suggestion, (d) out-of-scope.\n3) Pick the smallest actionable item (ONE thread at a time): implement the minimal change that resolves it.\n4) Run the fastest relevant local validation (targeted tests/lint/typecheck/build). If not available, rely on CI but still do best-effort local checks.\n5) Commit with a clear message referencing the thread/topic. Push.\n6) Reply in the PR thread describing exactly what you changed and where (files/lines), and mark the thread resolved if appropriate.\n7) Re-check CI status. If failing, fix the failure, push, and update any relevant PR replies.\n8) Repeat until all threads are resolved AND all required checks are green AND the plan is complete.\n\nCOMMUNICATION RULES:\n- Always reply politely and concretely. If disagreeing, explain why and propose an alternative.\n- If a comment requires a product/architecture decision that you cannot infer from context, ask a single concise question in the PR and create a TODO note, then continue with other threads.\n\nESCAPE HATCH:\n- After 25 iterations, if not complete, output <promise>BLOCKED</promise> and include: (1) remaining unresolved threads with links/quotes, (2) latest CI failures with logs summary, (3) what you tried, (4) the minimal questions needed from a human to proceed.\n\nOUTPUT: Only output <promise>PR_READY</promise> when ALL success criteria are met.
