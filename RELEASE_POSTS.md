# PageSpace Release Posts - November 2025

## Twitter/Threads (Short Format)

### Post 1: Global Agent Dashboard

PageSpace just got a major upgrade: **Global Agent Dashboard**

Talk to ANY custom AI agent from one central screen.

Build specialized agents throughout your workspace - a code reviewer, a writing assistant, a research helper - then switch between them instantly from /dashboard.

Your agents. Your rules. One command center.

### Post 2: Drive Prompts

New in PageSpace: **Drive Prompts**

Like Claude Projects, but for your entire workspace.

Set custom AI instructions at the drive level. Every agent and AI chat in that drive can inherit context about:
- What the drive is for
- How to navigate its structure
- Project-specific guidelines

Your AI finally understands your workspace.

### Post 3: Role-Based Permissions

Introducing **Custom Roles** in PageSpace

Stop managing permissions page-by-page.

Create role templates like "Editor", "Reviewer", or "Guest" with preset permissions. Assign roles to team members, then add per-page overrides when needed.

Template + Exceptions = Flexible access control without the headache.

### Thread Version (All 3)

**1/4** Big PageSpace update just dropped. Three features that change how you work with AI workspaces:

**2/4** **Global Agent Dashboard**: Switch between ANY custom agent from /dashboard. Build a code reviewer, a writer, a researcher - access them all from one screen. Your agents live in your file tree, talk to them from anywhere.

**3/4** **Drive Prompts**: Set AI instructions at the workspace level. Like Claude Projects but for drives. Your global assistant and page AI can inherit this context - so AI actually understands your project structure.

**4/4** **Role-Based Permissions**: Create permission templates (Editor, Reviewer, Guest). Assign to members, add page-specific overrides. Finally - sane access control for teams.

### Combined Release Post

**PageSpace November Update: Three Features That Transform AI Workspaces**

We've shipped three major features that fundamentally change how teams work with AI in PageSpace:

---

**1. Global Agent Dashboard**

Your custom AI agents are no longer isolated. The new /dashboard lets you switch between ANY AI_CHAT agent in your workspace from a single screen.

Build specialized agents throughout your file tree - a code reviewer that knows your style guide, a writing assistant tuned for your brand voice, a research helper with your preferred sources. Then access them all from one central command center.

The agents live in your workspace structure (so you can organize them how you want), but you can talk to any of them without navigating to their page. Conversation history stays linked to each agent, and when you update an agent's configuration, it applies everywhere.

---

**2. Drive Prompts (AI Instructions)**

Every drive can now have custom AI instructions - similar to Claude Projects, but integrated into your workspace hierarchy.

Set context at the drive level: what the workspace is for, how it's structured, project-specific guidelines, preferred terminology. Your global assistant and individual AI chats can opt-in to inherit this context.

The result: AI that actually understands your project without repeating yourself in every conversation.

---

**3. Role-Based Page Permissions**

Managing permissions across dozens of pages was painful. Custom roles fix this.

Create role templates like "Editor", "Reviewer", or "Guest" with preset permission grids. Assign a role to a team member, and they get those permissions across all pages. Need exceptions? Add page-specific overrides without touching the role.

It's template-based access control with surgical precision when you need it.

---

These features work together: organize agents in drives with custom prompts, control who can access what with roles, and manage everything from the dashboard.

Available now for all PageSpace users.
