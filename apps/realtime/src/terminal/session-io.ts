/**
 * Session IO over HTTP — the realtime half of `read_session`/`send_session`
 * for a PTY session (the session family, Node Sandboxes epic).
 *
 * A machine-bound agent's shell sessions run as PTYs owned by THIS process:
 * the bytes live in `agentTerminalSessionMap`, not in the database, and the web
 * app has no way to reach them. So the web tier resolves + AUTHORIZES the
 * session against its derived handle set, then posts here HMAC-signed —
 * exactly the shape `terminal-activity.ts` already uses (`/api/broadcast`,
 * `/api/kick`, `/api/terminal-activity`). The signature proves the SENDER is
 * the web backend; node access was decided there, at the one policy site, and
 * is deliberately not re-decided here.
 *
 * Read is the `list_sessions` liveness sweep AND the scrollback tail in one
 * request shape: name the sessions you care about, pass `limit: 0` when all you
 * want is whether they are live.
 *
 * LIVE IS NOT ATTACHED. A session with zero viewers is still a running PTY (a
 * human closed the tab; the process kept going — or nobody ever opened it, see
 * below), so liveness is map membership and nothing else. And a session that is
 * NOT in the map answers `live: false` rather than an empty scrollback: to a
 * reader, "" means "the command printed nothing", which is a different — and
 * actionable — fact from "this PTY has never started".
 *
 * A shell that has never started is no longer a dead end, though (issue #2206).
 * `add_session` reserves a row; the PTY used to begin only when a human opened
 * the pane, so an agent that added a shell and typed into it was told nothing
 * was delivered until someone came along. Now the first read/send STARTS it,
 * through the same create the socket path runs (`startSession` -> the handler's
 * `ensureAgentTerminalSession`): zero viewers, billing from PTY start, and the
 * idle reap armed at creation because no viewer will ever leave to arm it.
 * `live: false` now means what it says — no PTY, and none could be started.
