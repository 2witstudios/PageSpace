    // NOT inherit --max-old-space-size from NODE_OPTIONS the way a separate
    // process does — each worker's V8 isolate keeps its own (unraised) heap
    // ceiling regardless of the parent's flags. 'forks' spawns real child
    // processes instead, so CI's NODE_OPTIONS heap bump (see ci.yml) actually
    // takes effect and the v8-coverage-instrumented run of this ~930-file
    // suite no longer crashes with "Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit".

    // Trimming the reporters (below) didn't fully fix it either: 2 forks still
    // hit the identical FATAL ERROR after all their assigned tests passed. Root
    // cause: the v8 coverage provider retains precise per-script coverage data
    // for every file a process has ever run, for that process's whole lifetime —
    // it never gets released between files. With the default fork count (~one
    // per CPU) on this ~930-file suite, each long-lived worker accumulates that
    // data across ~300 sequential files before finishing, eventually exceeding
    // even an 8GB ceiling. Raising maxForks shrinks each worker's file share
    // (and thus its accumulated coverage memory) well before it can build up
    // that far.
