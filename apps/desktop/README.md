# PageSpace Desktop

Native desktop application for PageSpace. This is an Electron wrapper that connects to your PageSpace cloud instance.

## Architecture

The desktop app is a lightweight Electron wrapper that loads your PageSpace web application from your cloud VPS. It provides native desktop integration including:

- **System Tray Integration**: Minimize to tray, quick access
- **Native Menus**: macOS/Windows/Linux native application menus
- **Auto-Updates**: Automatic application updates
- **Deep Linking**: Support for `pagespace://` URLs
- **Window State Persistence**: Remembers window size and position

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm

### Running Locally

```bash
# From the root of the monorepo
pnpm --filter desktop dev
```

This will launch the Electron app pointing to `http://localhost:3000` (make sure the web app is running).

### Building

```bash
# Build TypeScript
pnpm --filter desktop build

# Create distributable packages
pnpm --filter desktop package        # Build for current platform
pnpm --filter desktop package:mac    # Build for macOS
pnpm --filter desktop package:win    # Build for Windows
pnpm --filter desktop package:linux  # Build for Linux
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in `apps/desktop/`:

```bash
# URL of your PageSpace instance
PAGESPACE_URL=https://your-vps-url.com

# Environment (development/production)
NODE_ENV=production
```

### User Preferences

The app stores user preferences in the system's application data directory:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/desktop/config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/desktop/config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/desktop/config.json`

Preferences include:
- Window size and position
- Custom app URL override
- Minimize to tray setting

## Packaging & Distribution

### Code Signing

For production releases, you'll need to configure code signing:

**macOS:**
1. Get an Apple Developer certificate
2. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export CSC_LINK=/path/to/certificate.p12
   export CSC_KEY_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

**Windows:**
1. Get a code signing certificate
2. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export CSC_LINK=/path/to/certificate.pfx
   export CSC_KEY_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

### Auto-Updates

The app uses `electron-updater` with GitHub Releases for automatic updates. **Auto-updates are only enabled for macOS** builds that are properly signed and notarized.

**How it works:**
- App checks for updates on launch and every 4 hours
- When an update is found, it downloads in the background
- User is notified when download is complete with a dialog
- User can choose to install immediately or on next restart
- Update installs automatically when app quits

**Manual Check:**
Users can manually check for updates via **Help â†’ Check for Updates...**

### Creating a Release

PageSpace Desktop uses electron-builder to automatically publish releases to GitHub.

**Release Process:**

1. **Update Version Number**
   ```bash
   cd apps/desktop
   # Edit package.json and bump the version
   # Example: "version": "1.0.1" -> "version": "1.0.2"
   ```

2. **Commit and Push Changes**
   ```bash
   git add apps/desktop/package.json
   git commit -m "chore(desktop): bump version to 1.0.2"
   git push origin master
   ```

3. **Trigger GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Go to https://github.com/2witstudios/PageSpace/actions
   - Select "Build Desktop App" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Select the branch (usually `master`)
   - Click "Run workflow" button

4. **Review Draft Release**
   - The workflow will build, sign, and notarize the macOS app
   - When complete, go to https://github.com/2witstudios/PageSpace/releases
   - Find the draft release created by electron-builder
   - Review the release notes and attached binaries

5. **Publish Release**
   - Edit the draft release if needed
   - Click "Publish release"
   - Users with the desktop app will automatically be notified of the update

**Required GitHub Secrets for macOS:**
- `MACOS_CERTIFICATE`: Base64-encoded .p12 certificate
- `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PWD`: Password for the certificate
- `APPLE_ID`: Apple ID for notarization
- `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`: App-specific password for notarization
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`: Apple Developer Team ID

The GitHub Actions workflow handles signing and notarization automatically.

2. Check firewall/network settings
3. Ensure CORS is configured on your VPS

### Build Errors

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pnpm install`
2. Clear the build cache: `rm -rf dist dist-electron`
3. Rebuild: `pnpm build && pnpm package`
