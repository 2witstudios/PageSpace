# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to PageSpace are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`pagespace` CLI** — install `@pagespace/cli`, run `pagespace login`, and use verbs like
  `pagespace drives list`, `pagespace pages read`, `pagespace search text`, and `pagespace tasks
  create` without hand-minting a token first.
- **CLI login** — `pagespace login` opens a browser for an OAuth login with PKCE; `pagespace login
  --device` covers machines with no browser (CI, remote boxes). Both replace copying a token out of
  Settings by hand as the primary way for a person to authenticate.
- **`pagespace tokens create` / `list` / `revoke`** — mint and manage scoped agent/CI tokens from
  the terminal, the same tokens Settings > MCP already creates.
- **`@pagespace/sdk`** — a typed TypeScript client (`PageSpaceClient`) for the PageSpace API,
  covering drives, pages, roles, tasks, agents, conversations, exports, tokens, search, activity,
  and channels.
- **`pagespace mcp`** — a stdio MCP server generated from the same operation registry as the CLI
  and SDK, so Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, and other MCP clients get a tool surface that
  can't drift from what the CLI itself supports.

### Changed

- The MCP integration docs and the Settings > MCP page now lead with `pagespace login` for
  personal use, keeping token creation for agents, CI, and drive-scoped access.

### Deprecated

- The standalone `pagespace-mcp` npm package is deprecated in favor of `pagespace mcp` (part of
  `@pagespace/cli`). It keeps working exactly as before — same tools, same env vars — and now
  prints a one-line migration notice to stderr. See the
  [migration guide](packages/cli/docs/migrating-from-pagespace-mcp.md).

### Fixed

- **AI streams no longer lose mid-response content when the server process restarts** — an
  in-progress AI reply's content is now checkpointed to the database as it streams, so reopening
  the channel (or resuming on mobile) shows the restored partial answer instead of a stalled
  "streaming" indicator with nothing behind it.
- On mobile, the app no longer loads in the wrong theme and switches after first paint — a race
  that could leave the navbar "half stuck" in the previous theme's colors on iOS/Android WebKit.
  The saved theme is now resolved server-side before the first render, and theme toggles force the
  translucent "liquid glass" surfaces to repaint.
