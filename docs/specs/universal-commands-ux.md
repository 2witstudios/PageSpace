# Universal Commands — UX Specification (Phase 0)

**Status:** Locked behavior contract. Every UI phase (picker, settings, transcripts, execution) builds against this document; acceptance criteria below become test specs.

**Feature summary:** Users register pages as slash commands. Typing `/` at the start of a message in any AI input opens a command picker; selecting a command inserts an inline chip that, on send, injects the command's entry page into AI context. Commands implement the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io): the command's **entry page is the SKILL.md** (injected on use) and its **direct children are discoverable resources** the AI reads on demand.

This spec describes the **perfected end state**. Implementation lands in phases; the spec never scope-cuts.

---

## 0. Definitions & Model

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Command** | A registration mapping a `trigger` (Agent Skills name) + `description` to an **entry page**. |
| **Trigger** | The slash name typed by the user, e.g. `/release-checklist`. Satisfies Agent Skills name rules (§10). |
| **Entry page** | The page injected into AI context when the command is used — the SKILL.md equivalent. |
| **Resources** | The entry page's direct children. Listed to the AI as available resources; read on demand, never bulk-injected. |
| **Scope** | Where the command is registered: `built-in` (platform-shipped), `personal` (user-scoped, follows the user everywhere), `drive` (drive-scoped, visible to all drive members). |
| **Shadowing** | Two enabled commands share a trigger across scopes. Resolution precedence: **built-in > personal > drive**. The losing command is "shadowed" for that user in that drive. |
| **Chip** | The inline token rendered in the input after picking a command, serialized as `/[Label](commandId:command)`. |

### Command resolution

- **Given** a user in drive D types `/foo`, **should** resolve against the union of: built-in commands, the user's personal commands, and drive D's commands — deduplicated by trigger using precedence built-in > personal > drive.
- **Given** a personal command and a drive command share trigger `foo`, **should** execute the personal one, and the picker **should** show the drive one with a shadow indicator (§1.6).
- **Given** the same trigger exists in two different drives, **should** never conflict — drive commands only resolve within their drive.
- **Given** a disabled command, **should** be excluded from resolution and from the picker (it appears only in settings lists).

### Exposure gating (launch)

- **Given** a user whose `role !== 'admin'` (same check as `apps/web/src/app/settings/page.tsx` `isAdmin`), **should** see no command *authoring or invoking* UI: no picker on `/`, no Commands settings pages, no Commands drive tab. `/` types as a literal character.
- **Given** a non-admin viewing a message that contains a chip (which will occur whenever a gated-launch admin posts into a shared channel/DM), **should** see the chip rendered normally per §5 — never the raw `/[Label](commandId:command)` serialization. Gating hides authoring/invoking surfaces; it never degrades rendering of already-sent messages.
- **Given** an admin user, **should** see the full feature.
- **Given** the gate widens later, **should** require no UX change — gating is a visibility switch only.

## 1. The Command Picker

The picker **mirrors the mention picker's interaction grammar exactly** — `apps/web/src/components/mentions/MentionPicker.tsx` (panel), `MentionPickerPortal.tsx` (portal/positioning), `apps/web/src/hooks/useSuggestion.ts` (trigger detection lifecycle) — and the visual density of the emoji picker (`apps/web/src/components/ui/emoji-picker.tsx`). Only deltas are specified; everything unspecified behaves identically to mentions.

### 1.1 Trigger detection

`/` triggers with the exact same rule as `@` (`useSuggestion.ts` `defaultTriggerPattern`): valid at the start of the message or immediately after whitespace, anywhere in the message, any number of times — the only exclusion is an existing tracked token's own range (a `/` inside an already-inserted chip is never a fresh trigger). Multiple command chips per message are supported; each resolves independently (§7).

- **Given** an empty input, when the user types `/`, **should** open the picker anchored to the input.
- **Given** an input containing only whitespace (spaces/newlines), when the user types `/`, **should** open the picker (position-0-or-only-whitespace rule).
- **Given** the `/` immediately preceded by whitespace mid-message (e.g. `hello /`), **should** open the picker — the mid-message rule mirrors `@`.
- **Given** the `/` immediately preceded by a non-whitespace character (e.g. `foo/bar`), **should NOT** open the picker; `/` is a literal character in that position.
- **Given** a message that already contains a command chip, when the user types `/` elsewhere in the message (outside that chip's tracked range), **should** open the picker — multiple commands per message are supported. **Given** the cursor is inside an existing chip's own tracked range, **should NOT** open there.
- **Given** the picker is open and the user keeps typing (`/rel`), **should** treat the text after `/` as the filter query (§1.4), mirroring `useSuggestion.ts`'s `textAfterTrigger` query extraction.
- **Given** the user deletes back past the `/`, **should** close the picker (mirrors `useSuggestion.ts` close-when-no-trigger branch).
- **Given** the user dismissed the picker with Escape and continues typing after the same `/`, **should NOT** reopen for that trigger position (mirrors `dismissedTriggerRef` in `useSuggestion.ts:100-103,222`); deleting the `/` and retyping it resets the dismissal.
- **Given** an IME composition is in progress (`compositionstart` fired, `compositionend` not yet — the `isComposing` guard in `ChatTextarea.tsx:81,122`), **should NOT** open the picker until composition ends; if the committed composition result begins with `/` at position 0, **should** then evaluate trigger detection once.
- **Given** a `/` typed mid-message then text before it deleted so the `/` is now at position 0, **should NOT** retroactively open the picker — detection runs only on typing insertions at the trigger position (next criterion), never on unrelated edits.
- **Given** a paste, drop, autofill, or any other non-typing insertion that results in a message starting with `/` (e.g. pasting `/foo bar`), **should NOT** open the picker; the text stays literal. Normatively: the picker opens only when a *typing insertion* — a keystroke or committed IME composition that inserts the `/` character, distinguishable via `InputEvent.inputType` (`insertText` / final `insertCompositionText`) — places `/` at the trigger position. Note the mirrored `useSuggestion.ts` detects triggers by value-diffing alone and cannot make this distinction; implementations must extend it (inspect the native `InputEvent`, or gate with a suppression flag in the spirit of its `suppressMentionDetection`).

### 1.2 Surfaces

- **Given** any AI-capable input — AI chat (`apps/web/src/components/ai/chat/input/ChatTextarea.tsx` consumers), assistant sidebar, channels, DMs, thread composers — **should** offer the same picker with identical behavior.
- **Given** a channel or DM **without** an AI participant, **should** still offer the picker and chip insertion (the chip is inert on send — §6).

### 1.3 Open/close lifecycle

Mirrors `MentionPickerPortal.tsx`, with the focus-model deltas noted here and in §1.4/§9:

- **Given** the picker opens, **should** render in a `createPortal` to `document.body`, `position: fixed`, `zIndex: 50`, in a `bg-popover border border-border rounded-md shadow-md` container (`MentionPickerPortal.tsx:136-138`).
- **Given** `popupPlacement='top'` (docked inputs — the default for chat/channel composers, see `ChannelInput.tsx:378`), **should** position above the input using the `bottom` strategy; **given** `popupPlacement='bottom'` (centered/empty-state inputs), below using `top` — both via `positioningService.calculateTextareaPosition` semantics.
- **Given** the viewport edges, **should** clamp width to 256–320 px and left position to ≥8 px from either edge, and cap `maxHeight` to the space between the anchor and the viewport edge minus 8 px (`MentionPickerPortal.tsx:115-133`).
- **Given** the picker is open, **should** close on: Escape (capture-phase document listener, `MentionPickerPortal.tsx:100-110`), click outside, selection, the trigger `/` being deleted, or the input unmounting.
- **Given** the picker closes, **should** require no focus restoration on trigger-opened invocations — focus never left the textarea (§9). The portal's `returnFocusRef` dance (`MentionPickerPortal.tsx:41-48`) exists only because of its autofocused inner search input, which this picker omits; a button-opened popover variant, if any surface adds one, restores focus to its trigger button like the portal does.
- **Given** the picker opens, **should** reset query to the text already typed after `/` (`initialQuery`), and reset selection index to 0 (`MentionPickerPortal.tsx:51-57`).

### 1.4 Filtering & list content

- **Given** an open picker with empty query, **should** list all resolvable enabled commands for this user + drive, ordered: built-in, personal, drive; alphabetical by trigger within each scope. Shadowed commands appear (with indicator), disabled commands do not.
- **Given** a query `q`, **should** filter with 200 ms debounce (mirrors `MentionPickerPortal.tsx:88-97`) matching `q` case-insensitively against trigger (prefix matches ranked first, then substring) and description (substring). Shadowed commands remain in filtered results.
- **Given** results are loading, **should** show the mention picker's loading row: spinner + "Loading…" (`MentionPicker.tsx:105-109`).
- **Given** a query with no matches, **should** show empty state copy: **"No commands match “{q}”"**.
- **Given** the user has no commands at all (no built-ins surfaced, none registered), **should** show: **"No commands yet. Create one in Settings → AI Settings → Commands."** where the settings path is a link that navigates there and closes the picker.
- **Given** a row, **should** render (left → right, mirroring `MentionPicker.tsx:113-160` row anatomy): `/trigger` in `text-sm font-medium`, the scope badge, the shadow indicator when applicable, and the description in `text-xs text-muted-foreground truncate`. Single-line rows, same `px-3 py-2` density.
- **Given** a row's description is truncated, **should** show the full description in a tooltip on hover/focus (delay per the app's standard `Tooltip`).

Deltas from mentions: **no tabs**, and **no inner search input on trigger-opened invocations**. The mention picker's All/People/Pages/Groups tabs (`MentionPicker.tsx:90-102`) do not apply; commands are one category. Unlike `MentionPickerPortal`'s autofocused search `Input`, the `/`-triggered picker has no search field of its own — the query is the text typed after `/` in the message input, and focus stays there (§9). A search input with placeholder **"Search commands…"** (mirroring `MentionPickerPanel`'s input) appears only in button-opened popover variants of the panel, if any surface adds one; none is required at launch.

### 1.5 Scope badges

- **Given** a personal command, **should** show badge **"Personal"**; a drive command, **"Drive"**; a built-in, **"Built-in"** — rendered in the compact badge style of the mention picker's group badge (`MentionPicker.tsx:129-135`): `text-xs`, rounded, tinted background, distinct hue per scope (personal = primary tint, drive = indigo tint matching the mention group badge, built-in = muted/neutral).
- **Given** any badge, **should** be announced to screen readers as part of the option's accessible name (e.g. "/release-checklist, drive command, shadowed").

### 1.6 Shadow indicator

- **Given** a command that is shadowed for this user in this drive (e.g. a drive `/foo` shadowed by the user's personal `/foo`), **should** render the row dimmed (`opacity-60`, matching the disabled-card treatment in `apps/web/src/app/settings/personalization/page.tsx:152`), with an indicator icon + tooltip: **"Shadowed by your personal command /{trigger}. The personal command runs instead."** (or **"Shadowed by the built-in command /{trigger}…"** as appropriate).
- **Given** a shadowed row is selected anyway, **should** insert the **winning** command's chip (resolution always follows precedence; the picker never lets you bypass it).

### 1.7 Keyboard navigation

Mirrors `useSuggestion.ts` `handleKeyDown` (lines 279-323) and `MentionPickerPanel` `handleKeyDown` (lines 55-71):

- **Given** placement `bottom`, ArrowDown **should** move selection down, ArrowUp up, both wrapping at the ends.
- **Given** placement `top`, arrow directions **should** invert (ArrowUp moves toward the visually-upper item) exactly as `useSuggestion.ts:289-304` does — visual direction always matches key direction.
- **Given** Enter with a selected item, **should** select it (insert chip, §2.1) and `preventDefault`/`stopPropagation` so the message does not send (the `context.isOpen` guard in `ChatTextarea.tsx:120`).
- **Given** Tab with a selected item, **should** also select it (delta from mentions, which ignore Tab; Tab-to-complete is the Slack/Discord convention). Shift+Tab does nothing special.
- **Given** Escape, **should** dismiss without inserting and mark this trigger position dismissed (§1.1).
- **Given** mouse hover over a row, **should** move the selection highlight to it (`onMouseEnter` → `onSelectionChange`, `MentionPicker.tsx:122`); click selects.
- **Given** the picker is open, all other typing **should** pass through to the input and update the query; navigation keys never leak into the textarea.

---

## 2. The Chip in the Input

The chip reuses the mention chip machinery: tracked ranges via the pattern in `apps/web/src/hooks/useMentionTracker.ts`, painted by `MentionHighlightOverlay` over a transparent textarea (`ChatTextarea.tsx:179-199`).

### 2.1 Insertion & serialization

- **Given** a command is selected from the picker, **should** insert at the trigger position: display text `/{trigger}` plus a trailing space (mirroring `appendSpace`, `useSuggestion.ts:133`), register a tracked range (mirroring `onMentionInserted` → `registerMention`), place the caret after the space, close the picker, and return focus to the input.
- **Given** the message is serialized to its markdown/API form, **should** encode the chip as **`/[Label](commandId:command)`** — structurally parallel to mentions' `@[Label](id:type)` (`useMentionTracker.ts:12`, `MENTION_REGEX`). `Label` is the trigger string; `commandId` is the stable command registration id (not the entry page id — renames and entry-page swaps must not break sent history).
- **Given** a draft is restored (e.g. via the editing store) containing `/[Label](commandId:command)`, **should** re-parse into display text `/{Label}` + tracked range, exactly as `markdownToDisplay` does for mentions (`useMentionTracker.ts:20-54`).

### 2.2 Appearance

- **Given** a chip in the input, **should** render through the highlight overlay in the same visual language as mention chips: primary-tinted rounded token over the transparent textarea text, typography locked to the textarea (`CHAT_TYPOGRAPHY`, `ChatTextarea.tsx:20` — the overlay/textarea line-height sync constraint applies unchanged).
- **Given** a chip and a mention coexist in one message — in either order, since mentions may be inserted into text typed before the chip (§2.3) — **should** both render via the same overlay pass; tracked ranges are disjoint by construction (the tracker only registers non-overlapping ranges and dissolves any range an edit overlaps, `useMentionTracker.ts`).

### 2.3 Editing & deletion

Mirrors the mention tracker's overlap-removal model (`useMentionTracker.ts` `updateMentionPositions` + the `validMentions` exact-text check):

- **Given** the caret immediately after the chip, Backspace **should** delete into the chip's text; any edit overlapping the tracked range drops the range, dissolving the chip into plain text (which, no longer matching `/{trigger}` exactly, stays plain). This is the same atomicity model mentions have — no special-cased whole-chip delete, but the chip never survives partial edits as a half-chip.
- **Given** a dissolved chip's text is manually re-typed to `/trigger`, **should NOT** silently re-chip — only picker selection creates a chip. Plain `/foo` text sends as literal text with no injection.
- **Given** text typed before the chip (making the chip no longer at message start), **should** keep the chip valid for send — chip validity is set at insertion; position-0 is a *picker-opening* rule, not a send-time rule. (Rationale: matching Slack, users may prepend a salutation after picking; the command still applies to the whole message.)
- **Given** the input is cleared (send or `clear()`), **should** drop all tracked ranges.
- **Given** a sent message is later edited (message edit flows), the chip **should** be preserved as an immutable token: the editor re-parses `/[Label](commandId:command)` into a chip, edits around it behave as above, and deleting it removes the command from the message. Re-editing **does not** re-execute the command — execution only ever happens when an AI responds (§6), never as a side effect of editing history.

### 2.4 Send

- **Given** a message containing a chip is sent to an AI surface, **should** send the serialized form; the server resolves `commandId`, injects the entry page (SKILL.md) into context, and lists the entry page's direct children as on-demand resources.
- **Given** the chip's command was deleted or disabled between insertion and send, **should** send normally and degrade gracefully — rendering per §5.2, execution skip per §7.2. The input does not block send.

---

## 3. Settings — Personal Commands

**Location:** Settings → **AI Settings** → **Commands** — a new entry in the "AI Settings" section of the settings hub (`apps/web/src/app/settings/page.tsx:82-100`), sibling of Personalization, at route `/settings/commands`. Hub row: icon `SlashSquare` (lucide), title **"Commands"**, description **"Register pages as slash commands for AI"**.

**Layout conventions** mirror `apps/web/src/app/settings/personalization/page.tsx`: `container max-w-4xl mx-auto py-10 px-10 space-y-8`, ghost "Back to Settings" button, `h1` with icon, `Card` sections, `sonner` toasts, SWR + auth-redirect loading states (`Loader2` spinner page while loading).

### 3.1 List

- **Given** the page loads, **should** show the user's personal commands in a card list, each row: `/trigger` (monospace-weight emphasis), description (truncated, tooltip for full), entry page title (link, opens the page), an enable/disable `Switch`, and an overflow/row affordance for Edit and Delete.
- **Given** zero personal commands, **should** show an empty state card: **"No commands yet"** with subtext **"Commands let you inject a page's knowledge into any AI conversation by typing /its-name."** and a primary **"New command"** button.
- **Given** a command whose entry page is in the trash or no longer accessible, **should** badge the row **"Entry page unavailable"** (destructive-tinted badge) with tooltip **"The entry page for this command is in the trash or you've lost access to it. The command is skipped until this is fixed."**
- **Given** the enable/disable switch is toggled, **should** apply optimistically with toast **"Command /{trigger} enabled"** / **"Command /{trigger} disabled"**, reverting on error with toast **"Failed to update command"** (mirroring the optimistic toggle pattern in `personalization/page.tsx:69-84`).
- **Given** a personal command that shadows a drive command in at least one of the user's drives, **should** show the shadow indicator with tooltip **"This command shadows a drive command with the same trigger."**

### 3.2 Create / Edit form

Opens as a dialog (or inline card on mobile) with fields:

1. **Trigger** — text input, prefixed with a literal `/` adornment. Auto-lowercases as the user types; spaces are converted to hyphens on input.
2. **Description** — textarea, helper text below: **"Describe what this command does *and when the AI should use it.* This is shown in the picker and given to the AI."** Live character counter `n / 1,024`.
3. **Entry page** — page picker reusing the mention search machinery with `allowedTypes={['page']}`, in a popover (`MentionPickerPopover`, `MentionPicker.tsx:260-287`). The personal form needs a cross-drive search with **no** `driveId`; note that `MentionPicker`'s `driveId` prop is required and its fetch always embeds it (`MentionPicker.tsx:172,204`), while only `MentionPickerPortal`'s fetch supports the driveId-less cross-drive call (`MentionPickerPortal.tsx:63,69-72`) — the panel must be wired to that fetch path (a small extension, not plain reuse). Selected page renders as a chip with title + drive name and an × to clear.
4. **Enabled** — switch, default on.

- **Given** the form is opened for editing, **should** prefill all fields; changing the trigger is allowed and takes effect immediately on save (sent history is unaffected because chips store `commandId`).
- **Given** Save with all validations passing, **should** persist, close, toast **"Command /{trigger} created"** / **"Command /{trigger} updated"**, and the picker reflects it immediately (no refresh).
- **Given** Save fails server-side, **should** keep the form open with toast **"Failed to save command"**.
- **Given** unsaved changes and an attempted dismiss, **should** confirm discard.

### 3.3 Validation states (inline, on blur + on submit)

All errors render inline beneath their field in destructive text. Exact copy in §10. Advisory warnings render in amber/warning style and **never block save**.

- **Given** an entry page is selected, **should** immediately fetch its size and, if it exceeds ~5,000 tokens or 500 lines, show the advisory warning (§10, W1) under the field — non-blocking.
- **Given** a trigger that duplicates another command in the same scope — enabled **or** disabled; triggers are unique per scope, so toggling a command's enabled state can never create a collision — **should** show E6. **Given** it matches a built-in trigger, **should** show E7. **Given** it collides with a command in another scope (e.g. a personal trigger matching a drive command), **should** show the non-blocking shadow notice (§10, W2), since cross-scope shadowing is legal.

### 3.4 Delete

- **Given** Delete is chosen, **should** confirm with a destructive dialog: title **"Delete /{trigger}?"**, body **"This removes the command for you. Pages are not deleted. Messages that already used this command keep their chip but show it as removed."** Buttons: Cancel / **Delete command** (destructive).
- **Given** deletion succeeds, **should** toast **"Command /{trigger} deleted"**.

---

## 4. Settings — Drive Commands Tab

**Location:** a new **"Commands"** item in drive settings (`apps/web/src/app/dashboard/[driveId]/settings/`), following the drive settings hub conventions (`SettingsRow` sections, same skeleton/loading patterns as `settings/page.tsx` there). Route: `/dashboard/[driveId]/settings/commands`.

### 4.1 Access

Delta from the drive settings hub, which hard-blocks non-managers (`canManage = drive?.isOwned || drive?.role === 'ADMIN'` with an Access Denied screen): the Commands route is **readable by every drive member**.

- **Given** an owner or admin (`isOwned || role === 'ADMIN'` — same predicate the hub uses), **should** get full authoring: create, edit, delete, enable/disable.
- **Given** a member without those roles, **should** see the same list **read-only**: no New button, no row actions, switches rendered disabled, with a passive notice: **"Only drive owners and admins can manage drive commands."**
- **Given** a member deep-links to the route, **should** see the read-only view (not the hub's Access Denied screen).

### 4.2 List, form, validation

Identical to §3.1–3.4 with these deltas:

- **Given** drive-scoped copy, **should** read: empty state subtext **"Drive commands are available to everyone in this drive."**; delete dialog body **"This removes the command for everyone in this drive. Pages are not deleted. Messages that already used this command keep their chip but show it as removed."**
- **Given** the entry-page picker in the drive form, **should** be scoped to the current drive (`MentionPicker` with `driveId`, `crossDrive=false`) — a drive command's entry page must live in that drive. The sender's access to the entry page is still checked at execution time (§7.2), and a viewer's access governs chip navigation (§5.3).
- **Given** the duplicate check, **should** run against the drive's own commands only (E6, enabled or disabled per §3.3); a collision with some member's personal command **should** surface nowhere in this form — shadowing is per-user and shown in the picker (§1.6).
- **Given** a list row, **should** also show the author ("Added by {name}").

---

## 5. Transcript Rendering

Sent-message rendering goes through `apps/web/src/components/messages/RichText.tsx`. Mentions are preprocessed from `@[label](id:type)` into chip elements (`preprocessMentions`, `RichText.tsx:15-19`; chip styles at lines 262-281). Commands extend the same pipeline.

### 5.1 Normal rendering

- **Given** a sent message containing `/[Label](commandId:command)`, **should** render an inline chip displaying `/{Label}` in the mention-chip visual language (`rounded-md`, primary-tinted background, `text-sm font-medium`, `RichText.tsx:269,278`), distinguishable from mentions by the leading `/` and a small command glyph.
- **Given** hover/long-press/focus on the chip, **should** show a tooltip: **"/{trigger} — {description}"** plus a scope line ("Personal command" / "Drive command" / "Built-in command").
- **Given** the viewer clicks the chip and has access to the entry page, **should** navigate to the entry page (parallel to the page-mention anchor behavior, `RichText.tsx:260-275`).
- **Given** the chip appears in channel history, DM history, AI chat history, thread replies, and quoted messages, **should** render identically in all of them.

### 5.2 Deleted / disabled commands

- **Given** the command registration was deleted after the message was sent, **should** still render the chip (label is stored in the serialization) but muted (`bg-muted text-muted-foreground`), non-navigable, tooltip: **"This command no longer exists."**
- **Given** the command is disabled, **should** render the chip normally but with tooltip suffix: **"This command is currently disabled."** Disabled state affects *new* executions, not historical rendering.

### 5.3 Revoked-access / trashed entry pages

- **Given** the viewer lacks access to the entry page, **should** render the chip normally (the trigger + description are not secrets within the conversation) but non-navigable; click shows tooltip **"You don't have access to this command's page."**
- **Given** the entry page is in the trash at render time, **should** render the chip with the unavailable treatment of §5.2 and tooltip: **"This command's page is in the trash."**

---

## 6. Channels & DMs Without an AI Participant

- **Given** a channel/DM with no AI participant, when a message with a chip is sent, **should** deliver and render the chip for everyone (§5.1) with **no execution** — the chip is inert.
- **Given** an inert chip, **should** add a tooltip suffix: **"No AI is in this conversation, so this command didn't run."**
- **Given** an AI (agent/assistant) later responds **to that chip-bearing message** (a direct reply/answer to it), the command **should** execute at that point — execution always happens at AI-response time, never at send time.
- **Given** a chip-bearing message that is merely part of conversation history while the AI responds to a *different* message, its command **should NOT** inject — a command executes only for responses to its own message, at most once per response. Historical chips never re-inject ambiently.
- **Given** an AI participant is present (agent in channel, assistant in AI chat), the command **should** execute when that AI responds to the message.

---

## 7. Execution Feedback

What the user sees when the AI responds with an injected command.

### 7.1 Context indicator

- **Given** the AI begins responding to a message that used `/foo`, **should** show a context indicator attached to the assistant's response (above the streaming content, in the same slot family as tool-activity indicators): a small pill **"Using /foo"** with the command glyph.
- **Given** the response completes, **should** keep the indicator persistently on the message (collapsed/subtle), so transcripts show *that* a command informed the answer. Tooltip: **"The page “{entry page title}” was added to the AI's context for this response."**
- **Given** the AI reads one of the command's child resources during the response, **should** surface it through the existing tool-call activity UI (read_page et al.) — no new UI; resources are normal reads.

### 7.2 Degraded execution

- **Given** at AI-response time the entry page is trashed, or the *sender* has lost access to it, or the command was deleted/disabled, **should** skip injection and render a visible notice in the indicator slot: **"Skipped /foo — {reason}"** where reason is one of: **"its page is in the trash"**, **"you no longer have access to its page"**, **"the command no longer exists"**, **"the command is disabled"**.
- **Given** a skip, the AI **should** still respond to the message text normally; the skip notice is informational, never an error state that blocks the response.
- **Given** the advisory size threshold is exceeded (entry page grew past ~5k tokens after registration), **should NOT** skip — inject anyway; the threshold is advisory at authoring time only.

---

## 8. Mobile (Capacitor) & Desktop (Electron)

Same components everywhere; platform deltas only.

- **Given** a touch keyboard, typing `/` from the symbols layer at message start **should** open the picker identically — detection keys off typing insertions in the `input`/`beforeinput` stream (§1.1), not raw keydown codes, so layered/long-press keyboard input works.
- **Given** IME/predictive composition on mobile, the composition guard of §1.1 **should** apply (`isComposing || e.nativeEvent.isComposing`, `ChatTextarea.tsx:122`), and the picker **should NOT** flicker open on intermediate composition states.
- **Given** the mobile keyboard is open, the picker's `maxHeight` math **should** use the visual viewport (`getViewportHeight()` / `window.visualViewport`, `MentionPickerPortal.tsx:115-116`) so the list sits fully between the input and the keyboard top — never under the keyboard. Keyboard open/height state comes from `useMobileKeyboard` (`apps/web/src/hooks/useMobileKeyboard.ts`) / the `--keyboard-height` CSS var.
- **Given** a small viewport (<360 px wide), the picker width clamp (256–320 px, §1.3) **should** hold with the 8 px edge margins; rows stay single-line with truncation.
- **Given** a mobile on-screen keyboard, Enter **should** insert a newline rather than send (`useEnterToSend`, `ChatTextarea.tsx:120`) — including while the picker is open; soft-keyboard Enter never selects a row, tapping is the selection mechanism. **Given** an external/hardware keyboard on tablet or desktop, Enter **should** behave per §1.7 (selects while the picker is open).
- **Given** touch, **should** select a row directly on first tap — no hover state exists (§1.7's hover-highlight is pointer-only) and no two-tap select.
- **Given** Electron desktop, behavior **should** be identical to web; no Electron-specific accelerators are registered for `/`.
- **Given** mobile settings, the create/edit form of §3.2 **should** render as a full-height sheet instead of a centered dialog; field behavior is identical.

## 9. Accessibility

`MentionPickerPanel` already provides `role="listbox"` / `role="option"` / `aria-selected` (`MentionPicker.tsx:113-120`) — mirror that, and close its gaps (the mention picker has **no** combobox wiring, no `aria-activedescendant`, no live region; the command picker must do this properly, and these improvements should be back-ported to mentions when convenient):

- **Given** the picker is closed, the message textarea **should** carry `role="combobox"`, `aria-expanded="false"`, `aria-haspopup="listbox"`.
- **Given** the picker opens, **should** set `aria-expanded="true"` and `aria-controls` to the listbox id; DOM focus **stays in the textarea** (the user keeps typing the query there — delta from `MentionPickerPortal`'s autofocused inner search `Input`, which steals focus; the command picker filters from the message input itself and has no inner search field on trigger-opened invocations).
- **Given** keyboard selection moves, **should** update `aria-activedescendant` on the textarea to the active option's id; options carry `aria-selected`.
- **Given** results change, **should** announce via a polite live region: **"{n} commands available"** / **"No commands match"**.
- **Given** an option, its accessible name **should** include trigger, scope, shadow state, and description (§1.5).
- **Given** the picker closes via Escape, selection, or deletion of the trigger, focus **should** remain in the textarea with the caret where the user left it (focus never moved — §1.3). **Given** the picker closes because the user clicked or tapped another focusable control, focus **should** follow that interaction — the picker never yanks focus back.
- **Given** a chip in the transcript, **should** be focusable (`tabindex=0` when navigable) with the tooltip content available as its accessible description; inert/unavailable states (§5.2–5.3, §6) are part of the description.
- **Given** the execution indicator (§7), **should** be a polite live-region announcement once per response: **"Using command /foo"** or the skip notice text.
- **Given** settings forms, every validation error **should** be programmatically associated with its field via `aria-describedby` and announced on submit failure; the size advisory uses `role="status"`, errors use `role="alert"`.
- **Given** reduced-motion preference, picker open/close **should** not animate (consistent with `useReducedMotion` usage in `ChannelInput.tsx`).

## 10. Validation Rules & Exact Copy

Trigger rules are the Agent Skills name rules: 1–64 chars, lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens, no leading/trailing/consecutive hyphens. Description: required, 1–1,024 chars. All checks run inline on blur and on submit; E-codes block save, W-codes never do.

The canonical enforcement lives in the shared validation lib `packages/lib/src/commands/command-core.ts` (`validateCommandTrigger`, `validateCommandDescription`, `RESERVED_TRIGGERS`, `resolveCommandPrecedence` — Phase 1). The UI must apply the same rules client-side using the copy below; the lib's own error strings are server/API-facing and are never shown verbatim in forms.

| Code | Condition | Exact copy |
|------|-----------|------------|
| E1 | Trigger empty | `Trigger is required.` |
| E2 | Trigger > 64 chars | `Trigger must be 64 characters or fewer.` |
| E3 | Invalid characters (after auto-lowercase/space→hyphen normalization) | `Trigger can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.` |
| E4 | Leading or trailing hyphen | `Trigger can't start or end with a hyphen.` |
| E5 | Consecutive hyphens | `Trigger can't contain consecutive hyphens.` |
| E6 | Duplicate within same scope | Personal: `You already have a command named /{trigger}.` · Drive: `This drive already has a command named /{trigger}.` |
| E7 | Reserved by built-in | `/{trigger} is reserved for a built-in command. Choose a different trigger.` |
| E8 | Description empty | `Description is required.` |
| E9 | Description > 1,024 chars | `Description must be 1,024 characters or fewer.` |
| E10 | No entry page selected | `Choose an entry page for this command.` |
| W1 | Entry page > ~5,000 tokens or > 500 lines (advisory) | `This page is large (about {tokens} tokens / {lines} lines). Commands work best when the entry page stays under ~5,000 tokens / 500 lines — move details into child pages, which the AI reads on demand.` |
| W2 | Personal trigger collides with a drive command (advisory) | `This will shadow the drive command /{trigger} in {drive name}. Your personal command will run instead.` |

- **Given** any E-code is active, the Save button **should** be disabled and the first errored field focused on attempted submit.
- **Given** only W-codes are active, Save **should** be enabled; warnings persist visibly until the condition clears.
- **Given** the user types uppercase or spaces in the trigger field, **should** normalize live (lowercase; space→hyphen) rather than erroring — E3 fires only for characters that can't be normalized (e.g. `!`, emoji).
- **Given** W2 with collisions in multiple drives, **should** list the drive names comma-separated in the `{drive name}` slot (e.g. "in Marketing, Engineering"); the rest of the copy is unchanged.

## 11. Forward Compatibility (Non-Goals)

- **Cmd+K palette:** out of scope. The picker, chip serialization, and resolution rules are designed so a future global command palette can reuse them unchanged (commands are addressable by `commandId`, resolution is input-surface-independent). Nothing in this spec may assume `/`-typing is the *only* invocation path.
- **Arguments (`/foo bar=baz`):** explicitly not in this spec; the serialization format leaves room (text after the chip is ordinary message text passed to the AI). (Multiple commands per message and mid-message triggers, previously listed here, are now implemented — see §1.1.)
- **Marketplace / sharing of commands across drives:** not in scope; scope model (§0) is the contract future scopes extend.
