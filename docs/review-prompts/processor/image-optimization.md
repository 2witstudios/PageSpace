# Review Vector: Image Optimization

## Standards
- review.mdc (always)
- javascript.mdc (always)
- please.mdc (always)

## Scope
**Files**: `apps/processor/src/services/**`, `apps/processor/src/workers/**`
**Level**: service

## Context
Uploaded images are resized, converted to efficient formats, and have thumbnails generated by worker processes in the processor service. Review that image pipelines handle edge cases like corrupt files, unusually large dimensions, and animated formats without crashing. Verify that output quality settings and format choices are appropriate for the use case.
