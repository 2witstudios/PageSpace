# Review Vector: Naming Conventions

## Standards
- review.mdc (always)
- javascript.mdc (always)
- please.mdc (always)

## Scope
**Files**: `apps/web/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}`, `packages/**/*.ts`
**Level**: architectural

## Context
Consistent naming across files, variables, components, hooks, stores, and API routes makes the codebase navigable and reduces cognitive load. Review whether naming conventions are uniform (e.g., predicates use `is`/`has`/`can` prefixes, hooks use `use` prefix, stores follow a consistent pattern), whether file names match their exports, and whether the naming communicates intent clearly enough to serve as documentation.
