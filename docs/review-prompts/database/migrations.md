# Review Vector: Migrations

## Standards
- review.mdc (always)
- javascript.mdc (always)
- please.mdc (always)
- database.mdc

## Scope
**Files**: `packages/db/drizzle/**`, `packages/db/src/migrate.ts`
**Level**: service

## Context
Migrations are auto-generated by Drizzle from schema changes and must never be manually edited or created. The migrate.ts file orchestrates migration execution during deployment. Review should confirm that generated SQL is correct and reversible, that no manual edits have been introduced, and that the migration runner handles failures gracefully without leaving the database in a partial state.
