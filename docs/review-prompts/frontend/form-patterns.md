# Review Vector: Form Patterns

## Standards
- review.mdc (always)
- javascript.mdc (always)
- please.mdc (always)
- ui.mdc

## Scope
**Files**: `apps/web/src/components/**`
**Level**: component

## Context
Forms appear throughout PageSpace for page creation, drive settings, member invitations, profile editing, authentication, and admin panels. The application uses a mix of controlled and uncontrolled form patterns with shadcn/ui form components built on Radix primitives. Validation approaches, error message display, submission state handling, and optimistic updates vary across the codebase. Consistency in how forms handle loading states, disable inputs during submission, and report server-side validation errors directly affects user experience and perceived reliability.
