# Review Vector: Notifications Routes

## Standards
- review.mdc (always)
- javascript.mdc (always)
- please.mdc (always)
- stack.mdc

## Scope
**Files**: `apps/web/src/app/api/notifications/**/route.ts`
**Level**: route

## Context
Notification routes handle listing, marking as read (individual and bulk), deletion, push token registration for mobile devices, and token-based email unsubscribe. Notifications are generated by various system events (mentions, task assignments, channel messages) and must only be visible to their intended recipient. The unsubscribe endpoint uses signed tokens and must work without authentication, making it a potential target for enumeration attacks. Push token registration must validate device ownership to prevent notification hijacking.
