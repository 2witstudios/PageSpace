# Override for hybrid dev mode: exposes postgres/redis ports to host
# Usage: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up postgres redis -d
#
# This adds postgres and redis to the frontend network, which allows port
# publishing to the host (the internal network has internal: true which
# disables port publishing).
