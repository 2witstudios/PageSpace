/**
 * Machine project path confinement (pure).
 *
 * A Project is a git repo cloned into a fixed subtree of a Machine's
 * persistent filesystem. The directory name comes from the caller (the
 * navigator UI / an agent), so it is `normalizeProjectName`d into a strict
 * slug BEFORE being joined onto `PROJECTS_ROOT` — no path separators, no `..`,
 * no leading dot — and the join is re-checked with the shared
 * `resolvePathWithinSync` confinement helper (belt-and-suspenders, matching
 * sandbox-paths.ts). `isValidProjectName` remains the contract the normalizer
 * must satisfy, and the second gate `resolveProjectPath` still runs.

 *
 * Unlike a branch ref, a project name is exactly ONE path segment — `/` has no
 * structural meaning here, so `slugifySegment` folds it to `-` along with

 * is what collapses `../escape` to `escape` — and `resolveProjectPath` still
 * re-checks the join against `PROJECTS_ROOT` regardless.
