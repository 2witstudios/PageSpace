 * Normalize free text into a valid git branch name — type "My Cool Feature",

 * `isValidBranchName`, which stays as it is: the predicate remains the CONTRACT,
 * and this function's job is to satisfy it for any input at all rather than to
 * reject the user.
 *
 * A name `isValidBranchName` ALREADY accepts is returned untouched, and that is
 * load-bearing, not a shortcut. Git refs are case-sensitive: slugifying
 * `Release-2.0` to `release-2.0` made `git checkout -b release-2.0
 * origin/release-2.0` miss the real upstream branch, and
 * `cloneAndCheckoutBranch`'s fallback then silently handed the user a NEW EMPTY
 * branch off HEAD while `origin/Release-2.0` sat there untouched. Uppercase and
 * `_` both pass the predicate, so both now survive.
 *
 * CAVEAT, deliberately accepted: the predicate is NARROWER than git's own rule.
 * Git would accept `_wip`, `fix#123`, `v1.0+build`, `日本語`; we do not, because
 * this charset is a confinement boundary (the name lands in `git checkout -b`
 * argv, a store key, and a scope key). Such names are therefore still rewritten,
 * and if one of them names an EXISTING upstream branch, git's fallback creates a
 * new empty branch off HEAD instead. `spawnBranch` reports that as `createdNew`
 * so the outcome is at least KNOWABLE — though nothing renders it to the user
 * yet; that belongs with the spawn-flow sub-task. Widening the charset to git's
 * full rule is a separate, security-reviewable change.
 *
 * `/` is structural — it is how git namespaces refs — so it survives as a
 * segment separator and each segment is normalized independently
 * (`feat/JIRA-123 Fix!!` → `feat/jira-123-fix`). Content-free segments vanish,
 * which is what disarms `../escape` (→ `escape`) and `a//b` (→ `a/b`); a segment
 * that DID carry a name the charset cannot express keeps a digest token instead
 * of vanishing (see `normalizeBranchSegment`).
 *
 * INVARIANT: `isValidBranchName(normalizeBranchName(x)) === true` for EVERY
 * string x, and the function is idempotent (immediate from the pass-through: the
 * output is always valid, so a second pass is the identity). The closing guard
 * makes the invariant total rather than merely intended — a slug that somehow
 * still fails the predicate degrades to the fallback instead of reaching git.
