   * Stamped with Postgres `clock_timestamp()`, not `now()`. `now()` (aka
   * `transaction_timestamp()`) is fixed at the transaction's `BEGIN` and
   * stays fixed for every statement inside it — including this one. If this
   * transaction blocks waiting on the `FOR UPDATE` lock above (e.g. a
   * concurrent role mutation holds it), the wait can outlast a concurrent
   * writer's own commit, and `now()` would then stamp a timestamp from
   * *before* that writer's newer one — silently regressing `updatedAt`
   * backwards. `clock_timestamp()` reflects the actual wall-clock moment
   * this UPDATE executes (after the lock is acquired), matching the
   * `new Date()`-evaluated-at-write-time semantics every other writer in
   * this codebase already has.

/**
 * Apply a reorder plan inside the caller's transaction: lock every target
 * row `FOR UPDATE` in ascending-id order, then write every position as one
 * batched `UPDATE ... FROM (VALUES ...)` statement. Returns the ids from the
 * plan that actually existed within `scopeWhere` (and were therefore locked
 * and updated) — ids in the plan that don't exist in scope are silently
 * skipped by the batched `UPDATE`'s `WHERE`, so this is the caller's signal
 * to detect that and decide how to react (e.g. `reorderDriveRoles` currently
 * rejects the whole request when any submitted id doesn't belong to the
 * drive; a caller adopting this primitive can reproduce that by comparing
 * this return value against `plan.orderedIds`).
 *
 * Locking in ascending-id order (the order `computeReorderPlan` already
 * produces) is what prevents two concurrent, overlapping reorders from
 * deadlocking — see `lockDriveRolesInOrder` in drive-role-service.ts for the
 * same contract applied to a single call site. Batching the write into one
 * statement instead of N sequential per-row updates is what closes the
 * window between those N updates that let concurrent reorders interleave in
 * the first place.
