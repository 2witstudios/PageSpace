/**
 * Pure audit-details sanitizer (#971) — GDPR Art 5(1)(c) data minimization.
 *
 * The `details` object on a security-audit event is folded into the
 * tamper-evident hash chain (see `computeSecurityEventHash` in
 * `security-audit.ts`) and therefore CANNOT be erased under GDPR Art 17:
 * removing it after the fact would break the chain. The only safe defense is
 * to keep user-typed text and PII OUT of `details` before it is hashed.
 *
 * Prior to this guard the only protection was a static source-scan test that
 * grepped search route source for the literal `query`. That test cannot catch
 * a runtime path that puts user text into `details`. This function is the
 * RUNTIME guard, wired into `auditRequest`/`audit` so every audit event is
 * sanitized before persistence.
 *
 * Design decisions:
 * - REDACT (not drop). We replace denylisted values with a constant marker
 *   rather than deleting the key. Keeping the key preserves the *shape* of the
 *   event for forensic analysis (you can still see that a query field was
 *   present) while guaranteeing the user-typed value never enters the hash
 *   chain. Dropping would silently change the object shape and lose that
 *   signal.
 * - Pure / referentially transparent. No I/O, no clock, no mutation of input.
 *   Always returns a NEW object for a non-empty input; identical inputs yield
 *   deep-equal outputs.
 * - Case-insensitive key matching, so `Query`, `EMAIL`, etc. are also caught.
 * - Value type is irrelevant: a denylisted key is redacted regardless of
 *   whether its value is a string, number, or object (PII can hide in any).
