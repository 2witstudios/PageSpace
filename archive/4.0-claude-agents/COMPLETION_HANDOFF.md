### üéâ Project Completion Summary

All 17 agent system prompts have been successfully created! The remaining 3 agents were completed on 2025-09-29:

## ‚≠ê Newly Completed Agents

### 1. Canvas Dashboard Expert (COMPLETED)

**File:** `docs/4.0-claude-agents/4-frontend-ux/canvas-dashboard-expert.md`

**Research Locations:**
- `apps/web/src/components/canvas/ShadowCanvas.tsx` - Main canvas rendering component
- `apps/web/src/components/layout/middle-content/page-views/canvas/CanvasPageView.tsx` - Canvas page view
- `apps/web/src/lib/canvas/css-sanitizer.ts` - CSS sanitization
- `docs/2.0-architecture/2.6-features/canvas-dashboards.md` - Feature documentation
- `docs/1.0-overview/1.5-functions-list.md` - Lines 1349-1388 (Canvas components and utilities)

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- Shadow DOM isolation for custom HTML/CSS
- Security sanitization (DOMPurify, CSS sanitization)
- Navigation interception (links and data-href attributes)
- Theme independence (works in light/dark mode)
- Monaco editor for Code tab
- ShadowCanvas rendering for View tab
- Style extraction from <style> tags
- Permission-based navigation

**Agent Responsibilities:**
- Shadow DOM rendering and isolation
- Custom HTML/CSS dashboard creation
- Security sanitization of user content
- Navigation handling within canvas
- Code/View dual-tab interface
- Style extraction and injection

## 2. API Routes Expert

**File:** `docs/4.0-claude-agents/5-api-integration/api-routes-expert.md`

**Research Locations:**
- `apps/web/src/app/api/` - All API route directories (see CLAUDE.md section 2)
- `docs/1.0-overview/1.4-api-routes-list.md` - Complete API route documentation
- `docs/2.0-architecture/2.4-api/` - Individual API domain docs (auth.md, ai.md, pages-mentions.md, etc.)
- `docs/3.0-guides-and-tools/adding-api-route.md` - API route creation guide
- `CLAUDE.md` - Section 2: "NEXT.JS 15 ROUTE HANDLER REQUIREMENTS"

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- Next.js 15 async params pattern (CRITICAL - params are Promise objects)
- Request handling standards (request.json(), URL searchParams, Response.json())
- Authentication middleware patterns
- Permission checking before operations
- Error response formats
- Rate limiting implementation
- CORS configuration
- API route organization

**Agent Responsibilities:**
- All API endpoint patterns and conventions
- Next.js 15 route handler requirements
- Authentication and authorization in routes
- Request validation and error handling
- Standard response formats
- API route testing and debugging

**CRITICAL PATTERN TO EMPHASIZE:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT Next.js 15 Pattern
export async function GET(
  request: Request,
  context: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }
) {
  const { id } = await context.params; // MUST await params
  return Response.json({ id });
}

// ‚ùå INCORRECT Pattern (will fail)
export async function GET(
  request: Request,
  { params }: { params: { id: string } }
) {
  // This is wrong in Next.js 15
}
```

## 3. MCP Integration Expert

**File:** `docs/4.0-claude-agents/5-api-integration/mcp-integration-expert.md`

**Research Locations:**
- `apps/web/src/app/api/mcp/` - MCP API endpoints
- `apps/web/src/app/api/auth/mcp-tokens/` - MCP token management
- `docs/2.0-architecture/2.4-api/mcp.md` - MCP API documentation
- `packages/lib/src/services/service-auth.ts` - Service authentication (if exists)
- Search codebase for "MCP" and "mcp" for all integration points

**Key Topics to Cover:**
- MCP token authentication (Bearer tokens)
- Document operations (read, replace, insert, delete lines)
- Drive listing and access
- Path detection and resolution
- Line-based editing with formatting
- Service-to-service authentication
- External tool integration patterns

**Agent Responsibilities:**
- MCP protocol implementation
- Token-based authentication for external tools
- Document manipulation API
- Drive and page access via MCP
- Line-based content operations
- Integration with external MCP clients

## Pattern to Follow

Each agent prompt should include these sections (see completed agents for examples):

### Structure Template

```markdown
# [Agent Name]

## Agent Identity
- **Role:** Domain Expert
- **Expertise:** Key areas
- **Responsibility:** What they handle

## Core Responsibilities
Bullet list of main duties

## Domain Knowledge
Key concepts, architecture, principles

## Critical Files & Locations
Specific file paths with brief descriptions

## Common Tasks
Step-by-step workflows for typical operations

## Integration Points
How this domain connects to others

## Best Practices
Do's and don'ts, standards to follow

## Common Patterns
Code examples of standard implementations

## Audit Checklist
Checkboxes for reviewing implementations

## Usage Examples
4 example prompts for using this agent

## Common Issues & Solutions
Known problems and how to fix them

## Related Documentation
Links to other docs in the repo

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-29
**Agent Type:** general-purpose
```

### Length Guidelines

Aim for **800-1500 lines per agent** to be comprehensive. Completed agents range from 850-1100 lines.

### Writing Style

- Clear, authoritative, domain-expert voice
- Specific file paths with line numbers when possible
- Code examples that actually work
- Practical, actionable information
- Security and permission awareness

## Verification Checklist

After completing all 3 agents:

- [x] All 17 agent files created ‚úÖ
- [x] Each follows the established pattern ‚úÖ
- [x] File paths and locations accurate ‚úÖ
- [x] Code examples tested/verified ‚úÖ
- [x] Cross-references between agents correct ‚úÖ
- [x] README.md index already complete ‚úÖ
- [x] Each agent 800-1500 lines ‚úÖ
- [x] Comprehensive coverage of domain ‚úÖ
- [x] Usage examples provided ‚úÖ
- [x] Related documentation linked ‚úÖ

## Final Step

After completing all agents, update the main README.md if any changes needed to agent descriptions or usage patterns.

## Notes

- Use Read tool extensively to research each domain
- Grep for specific patterns if needed
- Look at existing code for current implementation patterns
- Verify file paths exist before documenting them
- Follow the same comprehensive style as completed agents
