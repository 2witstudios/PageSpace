# Task Management System Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive task management system added to PageSpace AI SDK, including all new tools, UI components, and remaining TypeScript issues.

## ‚úÖ New AI Tools Added

### Task Management Tools (`/src/lib/ai/tools/task-management-tools.ts`)
1. **`create_task_list`** - Creates interactive task lists that appear as conversation messages
   - Creates database entries for task list and individual tasks
   - Links tasks to chat messages via `messageId`
   - Supports priority levels (low, medium, high) and time estimates
   - Returns comprehensive task statistics and next steps

2. **`get_task_list`** - Retrieves current status of task lists
   - Finds most recent active list or specific list by ID
   - Calculates progress percentages and completion stats
   - Supports filtering completed/incomplete tasks
   - Provides actionable next steps based on status

3. **`update_task_status`** - Updates individual task status
   - Cycles through: pending ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed ‚Üí blocked
   - Auto-updates parent task list when all tasks complete
   - Adds status change notes and timestamps to metadata
   - Broadcasts real-time updates via Socket.IO

4. **`add_task`** - Adds new tasks to existing lists
   - Maintains proper positioning within lists
   - Supports all task properties (priority, estimates, descriptions)
   - Links to parent task list and conversation

5. **`add_task_note`** - Adds progress notes to tasks
   - Timestamps all notes automatically
   - Optionally updates task status to in_progress
   - Maintains note history in task metadata

6. **`resume_task_list`** - Resumes task lists from previous conversations
   - Searches by ID or title across conversations
   - Updates conversation context for current session
   - Preserves all task history and metadata

### Enhanced Search Tools (`/src/lib/ai/tools/search-tools.ts`)
1. **`regex_search`** - Advanced content search with regular expressions
   - Searches page content and/or titles with regex patterns
   - Returns matching lines with context and line numbers
   - Includes semantic paths for human-readable results
   - Permission-filtered results based on user access

2. **`glob_search`** - Pattern-based page discovery
   - Uses glob patterns (e.g., `**/*.md`, `**/test-*`) for page matching
   - Searches across page titles and content
   - Converts glob patterns to regex for database queries
   - Returns both pageIds (for operations) and semantic paths

3. **`multi_drive_search`** - Cross-workspace search capabilities
   - Searches across multiple drives simultaneously
   - Aggregates results with drive context
   - Maintains permission boundaries per drive
   - Supports both regex and simple text search

### Batch Operations Tools (`/src/lib/ai/tools/batch-operations-tools.ts`)
1. **`batch_page_operations`** - Atomic multi-page operations
   - Supports create, update, move, delete operations in single transaction
   - Maintains data consistency with automatic rollback on failures
   - Maps temporary IDs to real IDs for dependent operations
   - Broadcasts all changes via Socket.IO for real-time updates

2. **`bulk_move_pages`** - Efficient page reorganization
   - Moves multiple pages to new parent locations
   - Maintains or reorders page positions as needed
   - Validates permissions for all operations upfront
   - Preserves page relationships and hierarchy

3. **`batch_rename_pages`** - Pattern-based page renaming
   - Supports find/replace, prefix/suffix, and numbering patterns
   - Case-sensitive/insensitive options available
   - Validates all renames before applying changes
   - Atomic transaction ensures all-or-nothing execution

4. **`create_page_structure`** - Hierarchical page creation
   - Creates complex folder/page structures from nested definitions
   - Supports all page types (documents, folders, AI chats, etc.)
   - Maintains proper parent-child relationships
   - Efficient batch creation with single transaction

## üîß Database Schema Updates

### Extended Tables
- **`aiTasks` table** - Added `messageId` field to link tasks with chat messages
- **`messages` table** - Added `messageType` enum (`'standard' | 'todo_list'`)

### New API Endpoints
- **`/api/ai/tasks/[taskId]/status`** - PATCH endpoint for task status updates
- **`/api/ai/tasks/by-message/[messageId]`** - GET endpoint to load tasks by message

## üì° Real-time Integration

### Socket.IO Events
- **`task:task_updated`** - Broadcasts task status changes

- Consistent state management between Page AI and Global Assistant

## ü§ñ AI Integration

### System Prompt Updates
Added task management instructions to Global Assistant system prompt:
```
TASK MANAGEMENT:
‚Ä¢ Use create_task_list for any multi-step work (3+ actions) - this creates interactive UI components in the conversation
‚Ä¢ Break complex requests into trackable tasks immediately upon receiving them  
‚Ä¢ Update task status as you progress through work - users see real-time updates
‚Ä¢ Task lists persist across conversations and appear as conversation messages
```

### Tool Integration
All tools properly integrated into `ai-tools.ts` with:
- Comprehensive input validation schemas
- Permission checking and user context
- Error handling and user feedback
- Socket.IO broadcasting for real-time updates

## üîí Security Fixes Applied

### Critical Vulnerabilities Resolved
1. **SQL Injection** - Replaced raw SQL with Drizzle operators (`ne()`, `ilike()`)
2. **Race Conditions** - Implemented atomic transactions for task creation
3. **Permission Bypasses** - Added comprehensive permission checking
4. **Error Exposure** - Added error boundaries to prevent information leakage
